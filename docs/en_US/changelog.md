Modify layout of the command's list changed since 4.2 version

Error correction in a function that force the mode if the target temperature and the chosen mode is not coherent. For example, if the temperature is 21째, the target temperature is 24째 and the mode cool is chosen, the plugin will force heat mode. 

Add an option in the equipment to activate or not the "force mode" function and set a temperature delta in order to decide if the mode is forced or not.

Add the step parameter on slider to have 1째 step and not 0.5째 by default. For this, wait one minute after updating the plugin before having the new step applied.
